## Branches
Your branch name should be the JIRA ticket number.
#get the latest changes from develop
$ git checkout develop
$ git pull
#create a new branch for JIRA issue PL-611
$ git checkout -b VSV-611

## Commits
Each commit should be a single logical change. Don't make several logical changes in one commit. For example, if a patch fixes a bug and optimizes the performance of a feature, split it into two separate commits.
Try not to split a single logical change into several commits. For example, the implementation of a feature and the corresponding tests should be in the same commit.
Commits should be ordered logically. For example, if commit X depends on changes done in commit Y, then commit Y should come before commit X.
Every commit should pass the tests.

## Messages
Commit messages should look like this (use git commit without a comment to automatically display a template in your default text editor):

#The title shouldn't exceed 50 characters maximum
#< --------------- 50 CHARACTERS ------------- >#
< Title should be capitalised with no full stop >
 
#The body should be wrapped at 72 characters
#<-------------------- 72 CHARACTERS --------------------------------->#
<Context for your change. This should not exceed 72 characters maximum >
<Try to explain the rationale for the change and any relevant business >
<context rather than documenting the change itself. The code should do >
<that. >
<If you need to list something: >
< - indent >
< - and use '-' to list >
#<-------------------- 72 CHARACTERS --------------------------------->#
 
[JIRA: <Put your JIRA Ticket number here>]
